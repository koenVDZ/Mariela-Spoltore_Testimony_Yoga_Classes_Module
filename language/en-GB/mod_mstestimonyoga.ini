MOD_MSTESTIMONYOGA_YOGA_1='“I started taking yoga classes for the first time about six months ago, it has been an incredible mental and physical exercise. Mariela teaches with serenity and understanding, she gives you exercises that allow you a different connection with your body and your thoughts, fundamental in the times of anxiety and uncertainty that we live through now. Thanks to the way she guides the movements, each class is unique, it broadens my perceptions. I fully recommend taking her classes.”'
MOD_MSTESTIMONYOGA_YOGA_2='“I take Yoga Classes with Mariela every Friday and I look forward to them with joy. It is a moment to connect with my body and my energy for me. It is a very important space specially in these times where it has been hard for me to go with the flow and take a mental and body rest. She is very kind and didactic. She also listens to us; the classes are prepared for the group and its needs. I enjoyed the classes a lot, I feel I renew myself every Friday. Thanks Marie!”'
